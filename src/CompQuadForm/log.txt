-all secondary functions have been tested with simple vectors/values and work properly
-the primary part (non-labels) of qfc has been run with simply vectors/values without error 
-individual functions within the labels were tested with estimated values similar to those which would be produced within the qfc function (excluding vectors) and run without error 

    -integrate was run with: 
        -l1:
            integrate(1, 16.0, 7.0, false, 3.0, 0.0, [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], 3) 
        -l2:
            -integrate(0, 12.6, 0.0, true, 3.0, 0.0, [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], 3) 
        
        -*Integrate function was also altered so that intl and ersm = 0.0 as it says in the qfc function. This should not alter the function; it is simply helpful for individual tests
    
    -cfe in l1 was run with:
        -cfe(13.0, [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], 3, false, [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], 3)
    
    -fundu in l1 was run with:
        -findu(16.0, 0.875, 5.0, [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], 0.0, 3) 



-Problems after testing: 
    -check if the intl value in integrate needs to be embedded in an if statement as in source
    -create another test for cfe function to ensure all parts are working properly
    -when labels are tested within the qfc function, no output is produced and the terminal does not allow for another input.
        - I do not see what code leads to the start of l1, so it seems to never be initiated and potentially runs an infinite loop (ends in return to l1) 



-General tasks that still need to be completed:
    -Compile C code and compare with qfc output
    -run simulation-one.jl tests 
        -ran sample of 100 files, but p-values were all equal to 0.0, so I changed value of log(1.5) in parameters4phenotypeSimulation to variable argument, "effectSize"
    -check simulatePhenotypesMediation function
